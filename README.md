# Noise-Cancellation-Using-Python

1.	Open VISUAL STUDIO CODE: Launch VS Code on your computer by double-clicking on the VS Code icon or through the Start menu. 
 
2.	Create a New File : In the VS Code command window, type "New File" and press Enter. This will open the new file. 
 
3.	Name the file name as filename.py: Since the project is working on a Python language, we have to name the file as filename.py to functioned the Python program that we have implemented.
 
4.	Enter the code: You need to enter the required code to run the Noise Cancellation. 
 
5.	Import wavfile: A lightweight package to read/write wave audio files to/from lists of native Python types. The package currently supports PCM (integer) and IEEE float formats, and supports arbitrary integer precision, including: 16-, 24-, 32-, and 64-bit samples.
 
6.	Import noisereducer: Noisereduce is a noise reduction algorithm in python that reduces noise in time-domain signals like speech, bioacoustics, and physiological signals.
 
7.	Copy the file location of the mav format: Copy the file location in the wavfile.read to read the file location.  
 
8.	Add a function: Add a function  noise_reduce from the library noisereducer. 
 
9.	Run the wav.write: Run the wav.write and get the denoised voice. 
 
By following these steps, you can get the output of the denoised wav.file voice.
